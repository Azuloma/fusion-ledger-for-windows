# Changelog

## v0.4.0

- Replaced the browser-wrapper MainWindow with a native WinUI 3 shell.
- Added the Windows App SDK TitleBar control, native NavigationView, local page search, account and notification flyouts, and honest disconnected placeholders.
- Added LoginWindow as the only WebView2 host with persistent profile authentication and strict `/api/me` parsing.
- Added latest-response-wins authentication coordination and local-only sign-out behavior.
- Sign-out now keeps a replacement LoginWindow alive, clears the active WebView2 profile through its supported APIs, and blocks navigation on clear failure.
- Added English/Japanese resources and updated build, security and unsigned-package documentation.

Known limitation: sign out clears local WebView2 data when possible but does not revoke the server-side session; commit notifications and tray/background operation remain future work.
